## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- ADA
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I ws able to applied some accessibilty practices to this form. I practiced changing the color of the outline based on whether something was selected or not. I also learned about triggering error messages for blank input.

### Continued development

I really like creating a dynamic interface that has client-side feedback for correct and incorrect inputs. I'd like to practice focusing on an area with a mistake. I was able to complete it here but I'm not sure how that happened. Making websites more accessible seems really fun.
